#Courses

ADI's schedule builder for Columbia.

Build instructions:

1. Set up [npm](http://www.npmjs.org/) (at least 0.8.0).
2. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. `sudo npm install -g coffee-script`
4. In this project directory: `npm install`
5. In this project directory: `grunt`
6. Serve `public` by running `grunt server`.
  (This also runs `grunt watch` for you automatically.)
